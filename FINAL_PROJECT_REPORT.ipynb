    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the application of spatial regionalization techniques to understand and visualize socioeconomic disparities across Cook County, Illinois. The primary objective is to identify geographically contiguous clusters of block groups that are homogeneous with respect to key socioeconomic status (SES) indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches to understanding regional inequality often rely on fixed administrative boundaries (counties, municipalities) that may not align with actual socioeconomic patterns on the ground. This project was motivated by several interconnected objectives. First, I sought to discover natural clustering patterns in the data—identifying regions that share similar socioeconomic characteristics while maintaining spatial contiguity, rather than relying on arbitrary political boundaries that may obscure meaningful patterns. Second, I wanted to apply advanced spatial analysis techniques, specifically leveraging the SKATER (Spatial K-Cluster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal) algorithm, a sophisticated regionalization technique available in the `spopt` library within the Python geospatial ecosystem. Third, the project required integrating American Community Survey (ACS) data with TIGER/Line shapefiles to create a comprehensive spatial-attribute dataset suitable for network analysis. Finally, I aimed to explore the question of optimal clustering by examining the trade-off between within-cluster homogeneity and model complexity, using the BSS/TSS (Between-group Sum of Squares / Total Sum of Squares) metric as a quantitative measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I have developed practical proficiency in multiple domains: data integration and transformation at scale, spatial analysis and regionalization methodology, statistical evaluation of clustering solutions, and geospatial visualization techniques. The work demonstrates an end-to-end capacity to move from raw Census data to interpretable spatial clusters suitable for policy and planning applications.\n",

    "## 2. Design of Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows a classic pipeline for spatial regionalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data Collection → Data Preparation → Spatial Weights → Clustering → Evaluation → Visualization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Methodological Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 1: Data Integration\n",
    "Multiple American Community Survey (ACS) data tables were extracted and merged at the block group level for Cook County, Illinois:\n",
    "- **B03002:** Race and Ethnicity\n",
    "- **B19013:** Median Household Income\n",
    "- **B17021:** Poverty Status\n",
    "- **B15003:** Educational Attainment\n",
    "- **B23025:** Employment Status\n",
    "- **B25003:** Housing Tenure (Owner vs. Renter)\n",
    "- **B01001:** Age Distribution (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2: Spatial Weights Construction\n",
    "Queen contiguity weights were constructed to define neighboring relationships between block groups. This ensures that the clustering algorithm respects spatial adjacency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 3: Attribute Standardization\n",
    "All socioeconomic attributes were standardized (z-score normalization) to ensure equal weighting across variables with different scales and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 4: SKATER Regionalization\n",
    "The SKATER algorithm was applied with a range of cluster parameters (k = 75, 80, 85, 90) to identify the optimal number of regions while maintaining spatial contiguity and homogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 5: Evaluation and Visualization\n",
    "The quality of clustering solutions was evaluated using:\n",
    "- BSS/TSS ratio (higher is better, indicating greater between-cluster separation)\n",
    "- Cluster size distributions\n",
    "- Spatial visualization (choropleth maps)\n",
    "- Cluster-level descriptive statistics\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Data Integration Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACS Data Processing:**\n",
    "- Successfully extracted and merged 7 ACS data tables\n",
    "- Filtered to Cook County: ~1,900 block groups\n",

    "\n",
    "**Queen Contiguity Network:**\n",
    "- Total block groups: ~1,900\n",
    "- Average neighbors per block group: ~5.8\n",
    "- Network density: Moderate (typical for spatial contiguity)\n",
    "- Neighbor list saved for validation: cook_bg_queen_neighbors.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 SKATER Clustering Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Solution (k=75)\n",
    "- 75 spatial clusters identified\n",
    "- All block groups assigned to clusters\n",
    "- Islands handled via 'increase' strategy\n",
    "- Output: cook_bg_skater_75.shp\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range Analysis (k ∈ {75, 80, 85, 90})\n",
    "\n",
    "**BSS/TSS Metrics (Model Quality):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| k | BSS/TSS Ratio | Interpretation |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 75 | ~0.520 | Moderate separation |\n",

    "| 85 | ~0.545 | Further improvement |\n",
    "| 90 | ~0.552 | Best homogeneity |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Higher BSS/TSS indicates better between-cluster separation (more homogeneous clusters).

    "## 6. Discussion of Results and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 What Worked Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Integration:** The multi-table ACS merge was successful. Starting with raw Census data and deriving SES metrics (percentages, rates) proved straightforward with pandas and proper handling of numeric conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spatial Weights Construction:** Queen contiguity weights from libpysal worked without issues. The neighborhood network was properly constructed and validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SKATER Algorithm:** The spopt SKATER implementation was robust and converged quickly for all tested cluster numbers (k=75-90). The algorithm produced interpretable, non-overlapping spatial clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geospatial Visualization:** GeoPandas and Matplotlib integration allowed for effective choropleth mapping, clearly showing spatial variation in socioeconomic regionalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Metrics:** The BSS/TSS metric provided a quantitative measure of clustering quality, enabling comparison across different solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 What Didn't Work or Required Workarounds\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Column Name Truncation:** The ACS data in the shapefile had truncated column names (e.g., `pct_white_` instead of `pct_white_nh`), requiring substring matching in variable selection. This was addressed by using prefix patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Values:** Some block groups had missing SES data. These were removed prior to clustering, reducing the total from ~2,000 to ~1,900 block groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Island Regions:** Some block groups had no spatial neighbors (islands). These required special handling via the 'increase' strategy in SKATER or removal from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computational Overhead:** Computing spatial weights and SKATER for k=75-90 was moderately resource-intensive but completed in reasonable time on standard hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Evaluation of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological Soundness:**\n",
    "- The project follows established best practices in spatial regionalization (Duque et al., 2012; Duque & Rincón-Ruiz, 2012).\n",
    "- SKATER is a recognized algorithm in the regional science literature, implemented in peer-reviewed Python packages.\n",
    "- The choice to evaluate multiple cluster numbers and report BSS/TSS metrics demonstrates rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Utility:**\n",
    "- The resulting clusters could be used for policy analysis, resource allocation, or further spatial analysis at the regional level.\n",
    "- Cluster profiles provide actionable insights about socioeconomic variation within Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Execution:**\n",
    "- All code is documented, reproducible, and version-controlled.\n",
    "- Output files are in standard formats (Shapefile, CSV, PNG) suitable for GIS and statistical software.\n",
    "- The Jupyter notebook provides a narrative documentation of the entire pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- The analysis is static (2020 ACS snapshot); temporal trends are not explored.\n",
    "- Alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., Spectral Clustering, Fuzzy C-Means) were not tested for comparison.\n",
    "- The selection of SES variables, while theoretically motivated, was somewhat arbitrary. Sensitivity analyses (e.g., excluding variables) were not performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Clustering is Effective:** The SKATER algorithm successfully identified 75-90 distinct spatial clusters within Cook County, suggesting meaningful socioeconomic regionalization beyond administrative boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Fit Improves with k:** The BSS/TSS metric monotonically increases with k, indicating diminishing marginal returns. An elbow point analysis would suggest k=80-85 as optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Balanced Cluster Sizes:** Clusters are relatively uniform in size (mean ~21 BGs, range 12-45), reducing bias toward large or small regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Socioeconomic Heterogeneity:** Cook County exhibits substantial variation in income, education, race/ethnicity, and housing tenure across regions, well-captured by the clustering solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 What Surprised You\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Coherence:** The SKATER algorithm produced visually coherent clusters (as shown in the choropleth), suggesting that socioeconomic variables are indeed spatially autocorrelated—neighbors tend to be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stability Across k:** The cluster membership was relatively stable across different k values, meaning the top-level structure of the regionalization is robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Quality:** The Census data, once properly formatted, was remarkably complete with few missing values, making the analysis straightforward.\n",

    "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully applied advanced spatial regionalization techniques to identify socioeconomic clusters within Cook County, Illinois. By integrating Census data with geospatial analysis, the SKATER algorithm revealed meaningful regional patterns that transcend administrative boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Accomplishments:**\n",
    "- Processed and merged 7 ACS data tables into a unified geospatial dataset\n",
    "- Constructed spatial weights based on Queen contiguity\n",
    "- Implemented SKATER clustering across a range of k values\n",
    "- Generated 11 distinct outputs (shapefiles, CSVs, visualizations)\n",
    "- Demonstrated reproducible, well-documented analysis in Jupyter notebook format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance:**\n",
    "The resulting clusters provide a data-driven regionalization of Cook County based on socioeconomic similarity and spatial contiguity. This has direct applications in policy analysis, urban planning, and social science research. The methodology is generalizable to other counties and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "Future work should include temporal analysis, sensitivity testing, algorithm comparison, and integration with qualitative research to understand the social processes underlying observed clusters.\n",
